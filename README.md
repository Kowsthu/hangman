# hangman
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters. The word is represented by a series of blanks, each representing a letter. The player guesses one letter at a time, and if the guess is correct, it fills in the blanks. For each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" figure is drawn.
